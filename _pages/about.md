I am a PhD student at [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/), supervisde by Prof. [Yizhou Yu](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~yzyu/) (ACM & IEEE Fellow) and Prof. [Ping Luo](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/pluo) . I am part of the [HKU MMLab](https://mmlab-hku.com/) led by Prof. [Ping Luo](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/pluo). During my PhD study, I collaborated with several researchers in industry e.g. NVIDIA, Sensetime and Bytedance. 

My work has focused on probabilistic modeling of high-dimensional data, large vision-language model and the application of this technique to various domains. Specifically, I investigate the efficient neural network, such as dynamic routing and knowledge distillation. I also had experience in the semi-supervised and self-supervised learning of object detection.

One of my recent notable contributions involves [RAPHAEL](https://raphael-painter.github.io/), a large-scale text-to-image generator featured in [SenseMirage](https://miaohua.sensetime.com/).

My research interest is solving challenging problems in computer vision and machine learning, including:
 - Diffusion model
 - Large vision-language model
 - Object detection 
 - Knowledge distillation

If you are interested in my research or collaboration with me, please feel free to drop an email.
